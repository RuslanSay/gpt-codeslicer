# GPT CodeSlicer

GPT CodeSlicer is a Visual Studio Code extension that simplifies organizing multi-file code outputs generated by ChatGPT or similar tools. It uses delimiter comments (e.g., `// path/to/file.ext`) to identify file boundaries and automatically splits the content into properly structured files and folders.

## Features

- **Multi-file Splitting:** Easily split concatenated multi-file code snippets based on delimiter comments.
- **Flexible Input Sources:**
  - Split code from the currently active file in the editor.
  - Split code directly from the system clipboard.
- **Dynamic Output Directories:**
  - Choose a custom folder.
  - Use the same directory as the source file.
  - Select a folder or file in the Explorer and split directly into that location.
- **Optional Formatting:**  
  If enabled via `gptCodeSlicer.runFormatterOnSave`, the extension will run the VS Code formatter on each created file after splitting, respecting the user's editor settings for indentation.
- **Optional Context Menu Entry:**  
  Control whether the clipboard splitting command appears in the Explorer context menu by toggling `gptCodeSlicer.showInContextMenu`.
- **Automatic Folder Creation:** Automatically creates directories as specified in the file paths.
- **File Overwrite Prompt:** If a file already exists, you are asked whether to overwrite or skip it.

## Commands

1. **GPT CodeSlicer: Split Files to Folder** (`splitter.splitFileToFolder`)  
   Prompts for a target directory and splits the currently open file into separate files.

2. **GPT CodeSlicer: Split Files Here** (`splitter.splitFileToSameFolder`)  
   Splits the currently open file and saves the resulting files into the same directory as the source file.

3. **GPT CodeSlicer: Split Clipboard to Folder** (`splitter.splitClipboardToFolder`)  
   Splits the system clipboard content into files, prompting for a target directory.

4. **GPT CodeSlicer: Split Clipboard to Selected Folder** (`splitter.splitClipboardToSelectedFolder`)  
   Splits the clipboard content directly into the folder (or the folder of a selected file) chosen in the Explorer panel.  
   Controlled by the `gptCodeSlicer.showInContextMenu` setting.

## Configuration

**Extension Settings:**

- `gptCodeSlicer.showInContextMenu` (boolean):  
  **Default:** `true`  
  When `true`, displays the "Split Clipboard to Selected Folder" command in the Explorer context menu. Set it to `false` to reduce clutter if desired.

- `gptCodeSlicer.runFormatterOnSave` (boolean):  
  **Default:** `false`  
  When `true`, the extension runs the VS Code formatter on each created file after splitting. It uses the user's `editor.tabSize` and `editor.insertSpaces` settings to determine formatting style.

**Example (settings.json):**

```json
{
  "gptCodeSlicer.showInContextMenu": false,
  "gptCodeSlicer.runFormatterOnSave": true
}
```

## Example

### Splitting from Clipboard to a Selected Folder with Formatting

**Setup:**

- Copy text containing delimiters into your clipboard, for example:
  ```
  // pages/Home.js
  export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Home Page</h1>;
  }
  ```

// pages/About.js
export default function About() {
return <h1>About Page</h1>;
}

````

- Enable formatting in your `settings.json`:
  ```json
  "gptCodeSlicer.runFormatterOnSave": true
  ```

````

**Action:**

- In VS Code’s Explorer, right-click on a folder named `website`.
- If `gptCodeSlicer.showInContextMenu` is `true`, select `GPT CodeSlicer: Split Clipboard to Selected Folder`.
- The files are created and then formatted automatically based on your editor settings (`editor.tabSize`, `editor.insertSpaces`).

**Result:**

```
website/
└── pages/
    ├── Home.js   (formatted)
    └── About.js  (formatted)
```
